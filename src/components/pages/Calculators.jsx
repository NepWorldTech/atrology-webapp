        <p className='text-center font-light '>As we all know that a calculator is a device that is used to calculate calculative things. Since childhood, we are using our calculators for<br/> mathematical calculations. But this time, AstroSage has developed some 'Pseudoscientific Calculators' to calculate things like, Rasi, Nakshatra,<br/> Moon Sign, Ayanamsa and many more. Keeping inevitable demands of Astrology and other pseudoscience believers in mind, AstroSage has <br/>developed some calculators like Numerology Calculator, Moon Sign Calculator, Rasi Calculator, Ascendant Calculator, Ayanamsa Calculator and<br/> Nakshatra Calculator, to name a few.</p>

        <p className='text-center font-light '>In Astrology, if we want to know the predictions for ourselves or particular someone, we have to give the birth details and name of that person. Everything in Astrology can only be known after entering the requisite details. Further, to read a horoscope, one should be aware of his Moon sign or Sun sign (as per the horoscope). Sun sign is the one that is classified as per solar calendar and Moon sign is the one that is classified on the lunar calendar. Similarly, Numerology can only predict things as per your lucky number; in that case, you should know your lucky number. <br/> <br/>

Obviously, most of the people are not aware of these things. That is why AstroSage has developed certain 'Scientific Calculators' for FREE to meet your demands.</p>
